- install MediatR on the project where you
  define queries, commands, and handlers
  - you need to define an entry point
    to facilitate the DI #TA01

- queries and commands are the same to MediatR
  - they all extend the IRequest interface #TA02
    - you specify what you will get from the
      request, and what to return in the response
  - we separate them logically for applying 
    CQRS pattern purpose

- handlers #TA03
  - this is where you put the business logic and
    access the data
  - you specify what command or query you want to
    handle, and you need to return whatever dictates
    by the command or query

- you can use mediator inside the handlers as well 
  to decouple the among the handlers #TA04
