- install MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection where
  you want to use the commands and queries to get certain tasks
  done
  - you need to configure the DI for MediatR to 
    target the assembly where the commands and  
    queries are defined #TA01

- you shouldn't be aware of the handlers, all you care
  is to issue commands or queries to get the job done
  and get the result back #TA02
